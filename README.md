<p> A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in computer science where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This structure is a specific type of tree data structure, distinguished by the limitation on the number of children each node can possess. </p>
<b>Key characteristics of a binary tree:</b>
<h6>Nodes:</h6>
    <p>Each element within the tree is a node, typically containing data and pointers or references to its left and right children.</p>
<h6>Root Node:</h6>
The topmost node in the tree from which all other nodes originate. 
<h6>Children Nodes:</h6>
Nodes directly connected to a parent node. In a binary tree, a parent node can have zero, one, or two children. 
<h6>Leaf Nodes:</h6>
Nodes that do not have any children, representing the terminal points of the tree branches.
<h6>Hierarchical Structure:</h6>
Nodes are organized in levels, with the root at the highest level and subsequent levels extending downwards.
<h6>Types of binary trees include:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Full Binary Tree: Every node has either zero or two children.</li>

<li>Complete Binary Tree: All levels are completely filled, except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.</li>
<li>Perfect Binary Tree: All internal nodes have two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.</li>
<li>Degenerate/Pathological Tree: Each internal node has only one child, resembling a linked list.</li>
<li>Balanced Binary Tree: The height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is kept to a minimum (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees).</li>
</ul>
<h6>Applications of binary trees:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Binary Search Trees (BSTs): Used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of data by maintaining a sorted order (left subtree values are less than the node, right subtree values are greater).</li>
<li>Heaps: Used in priority queues and sorting algorithms like heapsort.</li>
<li>Expression Trees: Representing arithmetic or logical expressions.</li>
<li>Huffman Coding: Used in data compression.</li>
</ul>
